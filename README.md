- This portfolio focuses on creating an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard using Excel. It examines job distribution, salary trends across roles and company sizes, and employment patterns by sector through pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for enhanced visualization.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Use the Provided Data
   - Open the Worksheet containing Uncleaned DS Jobs and the following Transform Tables:  
     - Salary by Role  
     - Salary by State  
     - Salary by Company Size  

2. Design the Dashboard to Highlight Key Insights
   - State with the most Data Science jobs  
   - Job role with the highest average salary  
   - Company size offering the highest salary  
   - Sector with the highest and lowest number of Data Science jobs  
   - Sector with the minimum and maximum average salary  

3. Create Pivot Tables  
   - Use pivot tables to summarize data on sector-specific jobs and salaries (steps d & e).  

4. Generate Visualizations
   - Create bar, column, or pie charts to represent salary trends and job distribution.

     
5. Insert Slicers for Interactivity 
   - Add slicers for filtering by role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive.  

6. Add an Optional Map  
   - If your Excel version supports it, include a map visualization to display job distribution by state.  

7. Apply Design and Formatting  
   - Adjust colors, fonts, and layout to enhance the dashboard's visual appeal.  

8. Finalize the Dashboard 
   - Ensure all necessary visuals and reports are included.  
   - Make sure the slicers are functional and interactive.
